    "### Introduction\n",
    "Topic Models, in a nutshell, are a type of statistical language models used for uncovering hidden structure in a collection of texts. In a practical and more intuitively, you can think of it as a task of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**, where rather than representing a text T in its feature space as {Word_i: count(Word_i, T) for Word_i in Vocabulary}, you can represent it in a topic space as {Topic_i: Weight(Topic_i, T) for Topic_i in Topics}\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning**, where it can be compared to clustering, as in the case of clustering, the number of topics, like the number of clusters, is an output parameter. By doing topic modeling, we build clusters of words rather than clusters of texts. A text is thus a mixture of all the topics, each having a specific weight\n",
    "- **Tagging**, abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents that best represents the information in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several existing algorithms you can use to perform the topic modeling. The most common of it are, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA/LSI), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll take a closer look at LDA, and implement our first topic model using the sklearn implementation in python 2.7\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Overview\n",
    "LDA is a generative probabilistic model that assumes each topic is a mixture over an underlying set of words, and each document is a mixture of over a set of topic probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![LDA_Model](https://github.com/chdoig/pytexas2015-topic-modeling/blob/master/images/lda-4.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe the generative process of LDA as, given the M number of documents, N number of words, and prior K number of topics, the model trains to output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `psi`, the distribution of words for each topic K\n",
    "- `phi`, the distribution of topics for each document i\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters of LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Alpha parameter` is Dirichlet prior concentration parameter that represents document-topic density — with a higher alpha, documents are assumed to be made up of more topics and result in more specific topic distribution per document.\n",
    "- `Beta parameter` is the same prior concentration parameter that represents topic-word density — with high beta, topics are assumed to made of up most of the words and result in a more specific word distribution per topic."
