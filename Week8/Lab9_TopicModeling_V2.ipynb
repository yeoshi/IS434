    "\n",
    "In this script, we perform topic modeling using the LDA approach (Python sklearn package).\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic Modeling is a technique to extract the hidden topics from large volumes of text. Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) is a popular algorithm for topic modeling with excellent implementations in the Python’s Gensim package. The challenge, however, is how to extract good quality of topics that are clear, segregated and meaningful. This depends heavily on the quality of text preprocessing and the strategy of finding the optimal number of topics. This tutorial attempts to tackle both of these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary applications of natural language processing is to automatically extract what topics people are discussing from large volumes of text. Some examples of large text could be feeds from social media, customer reviews of hotels, movies, etc, user feedbacks, news stories, e-mails of customer complaints etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing what people are talking about and understanding their problems and opinions is highly valuable to businesses, administrators, political campaigns. And it’s really hard to manually read through such large volumes and compile the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus is required an automated algorithm that can read through the text documents and automatically output the topics discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will take a real example of the ’20 Newsgroups’ dataset and use LDA to extract the naturally discussed topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) from Gensim package along with the Mallet’s implementation (via Gensim). Mallet has an efficient implementation of the LDA. It is known to run faster and gives better topics segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also extract the volume and percentage contribution of each topic to get an idea of how important a topic is.\n",
