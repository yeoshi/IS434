If you are craving good Chinese food come here."},{"author":"Tram N.","datePublished":"2016-03-13","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":3},"description":"Overrated. \n\nIf you order 1 or 2 orders of dumplings then you might be able to distinguish the taste but we ordered more than 6 orders (all different ones) so I felt that it all tasted the same after my 2nd dumpling. \n\nThe oriental salad was delicious and my favorite. The fried rice was incredibly tasty, too. The duck wrap I ordered was good but I would not order it again. I was not a fan of their BBQ pork buns (all dough and barely any meat filling). \n\nService was subpar. \n\nWe were ignored for a short while. \n\nI&apos;d pick the dim sum at the hawker centers instead."},{"author":"Sylvia K.","datePublished":"2015-09-06","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":4},"description":"I finally got to try the Din Tai Fung&apos;s famous steamed pork dumplings. There&apos;s a location in the Raffles City shopping center. \n\nThe verdict: pretty tasty! How do they make these? How do they get the soup to stay inside? The meat and the dumpling itself was delicious, but I wouldn&apos;t say it was mind blowing. Maybe I had high expectations because it was so hyped up. \n\nI also tried the steamed chicken soup, because the menu said it was another thing they were famous for. I didn&apos;t like this as much. I thought the broth was kind of bland and most of the chicken was white meat, so slightly dry.\n\nThey give you a pen and you have to mark down how many of each item you want. For the dumplings, you have the option of getting six pieces or ten pieces. And it comes out in one of those bamboo steamer baskets. \n\nOverall, tasty dumplings, but nothing to go out of your way for!"},{"author":"Bob U.","datePublished":"2016-09-18","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":2},"description":"I&apos;ve been here twice now. I waited to write a review because I wanted to make sure my first trip wasn&apos;t an anomaly\n\nI don&apos;t understand why everyone is so crazy about this place. one just opened near San Francisco and the wait time can be three hours. I figured I&apos;d try it in SE Asia. the second time there I waited for a single table almost one hour. \n\nthe service is lousy. a runner just dumps the dish on the table and leaves without checking if it&apos;s correct or you need anything else. but the worst part was the xiao long bao, both times, was dried out like it had been sitting on a warming shelf for a while. this is supposed to be the reason people come here. my order was wrong one of the times, but I was too annoyed at waiting an hour so I didn&apos;t complain. the sides were okay.\n\nI&apos;ll never come back"},{"author":"Michael B.","datePublished":"2019-01-25","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":5},"description":"Outstanding food and even better service.

Avoid the super snooty overpriced restaurants.  Find this little gem which truthfully isn&apos;t so little at all. And come hungry. They have an incredibly  wide assortment of dim sum as week as their speciality, soup dumplings. \n\n Nom nom\nYou will certainly not be disappointed. \n\nThough this location won&apos;t win any rewards in ambience and decor, it&apos;s clean decorum coupled with an efficiency in both acquiring a table and being served or food with 5 minutes of being seated, is an award all to itself. \n\nWhilst waiting to be seated you are given both a menu on a clipboard and a picture book of all the succulent options. Some options come in multiples of 1, 3, 6 or 10 so make sure to carefully discern quantity when making your selections. \n\nYou are also assigned a queue number which is conveniently illuminated at the entrance just above your head. Thus no mystery as to when you&apos;ll be seated. \nOnce your number your number is called, the hostess takes your menu, reviews your order with you before seating at your table which is being cleaned quickly during that time.  Once you&apos;re seated you receive the first of your items usually within 5 minutes.\nEFFICIENCY LADIES AND GENTS IS THE NAME OF THE GAME WHEN GOING TO MOST PLACES IN SINGAPORE."},{"author":"Lauren N.","datePublished":"2015-07-08","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":4},"description":"This was our first stop for food on the first morning of our most recent visit to Singapore. DUMPLINGS! I love the consistency. Every restaurant churns out the same great food and hopefully decent service. This place gives you a basket for your purse and a napkin to cover it- that way no dumpling juice or soy splashes it! We shared the pork and tofu noodles, pork XLB, shrimp and pork XLB, duck skin cigars and red bean sticky rice. All solid choices and I enjoyed everything we ate!"},{"author":"Anna R.","datePublished":"2019-08-29","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":5},"description":"I cannot recommend the truffle dumpling enough.

I like the egg fried rice (sometimes I get it with shrimp) and the wonton soup. Good stuff. Can count on it being the same every time I go. Of course, the xiao long baos are decent too."},{"author":"Kavita K.","datePublished":"2016-10-04","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":4},"description":"I realise I&apos;ve falled into a predictable pattern of late. Whenever I want dim sum, I go to DTF. Few restaurants have inspired such loyalty from me and that&apos;s simply owing to their reliable dim sum with consistent quality. \n\nNot to say there aren&apos;t ANY cons. The waiting time can range from 10-30 minutes on the weekends although they are kind enough to let you pick your food while you wait and make your order just as you are whisked to a table. The menu is a bit limited in my opinion. No char siew pau or chee cheong fun, two staples on the dim sum menu. It&apos;s also not particularly adventurous if you are into that sort of thing. \n\nHaving said that, whatever they do serve is very good promptly dished. The pork and chilli crab steamed bun is delicious, as is their soup dumplings. I&apos;m also a sucker for their mango pudding which I never have space for because I&apos;ve just gorged on 6 prawn and pork dumplings. \n\nIf you want some otherworldly dim sum, you won&apos;t get it here. If you just want a straightforward, good dumpling, this place will not fail you."},{"author":"Mark H.","datePublished":"2017-07-17","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":4},"description":"Wow.

I truly loved the island and took immense joy in exploring its varied culinary landscape.  It is special place populated by such amazing people (locals and expats).  From the depth of my heart, I hope I am able to return someday.\n\nThis is a review of dinner with two friends at Din Tai Fung in Raffles City Shopping Centre.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/lvn2cb4\n\nThis Din Tai Fung is located in the basement level of Raffles CIty.  It is pretty far into the level and can be a little difficult to locate.  Also, unless you arrive early for dinner, you should expect a wait.  I think we arrived around 6:30 or so.  We had a 20 to 25 minute wait for our table.  But, I think those arriving when we were being seated were probably having a little longer wait.\n\nThe ambiance is a notch above basic but still trends towards the functional.  I would not place it at the level of fine dining.  It lacks the attention to detail that a fine dining room displays.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kldx5xd\n\nThe staff is very effective.  I wouldn&apos;t necessarily use the word friendly.  Though they are certainly not rude.  Everyone just seems too busy and focused on their tasks to take a moment for overt politeness.  Also, the experience seems to be based on speed; get folks seated, get their order, get them their food ASAP, and get them on their way, rinse and repeat.\n\nThe food ranged from good to extremely good.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/lfurlwm\n\nCrispy Prawn Pancake - This was my least favourite dish. There wasn&apos;t anything  particularly wrong with it but it lacked layers of flavours that would have brought it up a notch.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/md9rrdp\n\nChicken with wine sauce - This was such a enjoyable chicken dish.  it is another example of a dish that allowed the basic ingredient to shine through.  The wine sauce complimented the chicken without overwhelming it.  Plus, the chicken was very tender.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/lyzsb9g\n\nPrawn Fried Rice - I love rice.  But I tend to prefer steamed rices.  However, if I keep running into fried rices as good as this, I may become a convert.  It was light.  The prawns were sweet.  The eggs provided a rich earthy note.  At some level, it was difficult to believe this was a fried dish.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/kcpztlb\n\nCold Pork - I enjoyed the flavours of this dish.  The lightness of the pork.  The freshness of the onions.  The nice touch of the sesame seeds.  All that being said, I would prefer this dish with the pork served hot.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/mc6hn5j\n\nPrawn Dumplings - I love prawn dumplings.  These were very good.  Fresh, hot, sweet, etc..\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/lpqr9n5\n\nXia Long Bao (soup dumplings) - This is the dish that brings a lot of folks to Din Tai Fung.   They did not disappoint.  Dipped into the vinegar and ginger and then popped into your mouth for a flavour explosion.  Just make sure not to burn yourself.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/m7efulr\n\nI do not know the cost.  My friends were kind enough to treat me to dinner.\n\nOverall - Din Tai Fung is about the food and they delivered.  For the overall experience, I would say this was more 3.5 star than 4.  The food definitely warranted 4 stars.  The service could be a little more personable and little less rushed.   But, I guess if they didn&apos;t hurry, we would all have to wait a little longer to get our delicious Xia Long Bao."},{"author":"Rachel C.","datePublished":"2015-01-31","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":4},"description":"Came here during my 2 week visit to Singapore about 3 times :) \n\nLOVED their seaweed/vegetable salad app, the pork dumplings, spicy cucumber and the shrimp fried rice. There was typically a wait if you came at normal eating hours, and even off peak there were always plenty of tables filled up! I do like the numbering system and how they call out the tables, easier to hear than names being called and lets you not stand in a line like other places in the mall. \n\nService was typically quick, although items came out as they were ready and not necessarily in the order that you would expect them. This didn&apos;t bother me as i was eating alone, but might be weird if you are in a group and ordering separately. \n\nAlthough this is a chain, i felt that this location was a nice option for dinner for almost any occasion from date night to casual eating alone. I think you have to visit one location of this restaurant if you are visiting Singapore!"},{"author":"Margaux L.","datePublished":"2015-10-23","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":5},"description":"Before traveling to Singapore for work, I checked out some Yelp reviews to see what the restaurants close to my hotel offered. I&apos;m glad I read reviews of Din Tai Fung because I made the effort to find it and ended up going three times during a two week trip! My hotel (the Swissotel) was connected to the Raffles City mall, so that made it very convenient, but I still would have made the effort to go back. \n\nThere was usually a line but it cleared quickly and the hostesses provided order sheets and menus so you could decide on your meal before you sat down. One of my favorite parts of the experience was the &quot;crib&quot; they provide for ladies&apos; bags and that once you put your bag inside they cover it with a napkin as if the bags are being tucked in for a nap. \n\nBut my most favorite thing were the dumplings. These soup dumplings might be the most delightful thing I have ever eaten. The sensation of putting one in your mouth and the warm soup bursting out (yeah, yeah, *phrasing boom*) just brings a smile to your face. The texture of the dumplings is firm, but soft, and the soup has great flavor. I tried several varieties, with the traditional pork being my favorite. The shrimp and the chicken were also good, but I didn&apos;t care for the crab very much. I also tried the shrimp fried rice and an eggplant side dish and both were great. \n\nI&apos;ve seriously been telling everyone about these dumplings since I went on this trip. If you&apos;re in Singapore, Din Tai Fung is a must."},{"author":"Marlin O.","datePublished":"2016-01-13","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":3},"description":"We were there on the last Saturday of the year so it seemed like it was a bit of a mad rush at the centre. Thankfully there wasn&apos;t the usual long queue at DTF as it was a late lunch. We pre-ordered at the queue to cut wait time but there was still a wait at the table. Luckily the beers didn&apos;t take too long! \n\nMy companions were vegetarians so we only opted for vegetarian dishes and were very pleased with our choices. The stir fried dou miao with garlic was outstanding as were the steamed red bean paste buns.\n\nService was so-so. Staff weren&apos;t rude but not that friendly either. One of our dumpling dishes was forgotten so we had to ask for it and there was a bit of a delay though it wasn&apos;t too long.\n\nIt was a pleasant experience and the flavour of the food is consistent with DTF in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Sydney."},{"author":"Scott G.","datePublished":"2015-06-27","reviewRating":{"ratingValue":5},"description":"Other than the Edge breakfast I enjoyed every morning, this was my favorite meal in Singapore.

The soup dumplings were absolutely delicious, and I can&apos;t complain about anything else we ate.\n\nI loved watching them make all of the food while we waited. Their kitchen is glassed in, and you can see them moving all of the trays around in the steam.
