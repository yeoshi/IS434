Network of the characters from the book Anna Karenina

Compiled by Jean Mark Gawron.

The file anna.gml describes a weighted, un-directed network
representing the network of Anna Karenina characters.

The edge (link) indicates that a pair of characters appeared together.
The weight represents the number of shared scenes between a pair of characters.
The weight value is normalized - by diving it by the maximum # of scenes shared.
