The location is already outstanding, just around the corner from a myriad of restaurants, bars and transport options. Once you cross the threshold you're transported to another time, where the velvet-cushioned furniture and the low lights bring the parisian spirit to bloom. The service and staff are outstanding, both during check-in and for amenities. The private hammam and pool provide a cocoon to be enjoyed in total calm, and the rooms are lavishly decorated. An extra note on the comfort of the mattress, bravo!
