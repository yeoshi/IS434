This is a small ramen restaurant. I waited so long in line with my family during the winter that I actually went across the street to another Japanese restaurant that served bento and sushi to eat before. I did it mainly because I was freezing. Kodawari is a small little restaurant that serves pretty good ramen, but not the best I have had. I messed up and had the original ramen so there was not much to brag about. My nephew had their specialty black sesame ramen and said it was great. We ate upstairs at the large table where you share space since it was the only table to seat 5. Overall, a good place to eat if you do not have to wait. Prices are above ramen average.
