This is a review that I would like to share not to give anyone a bad name but I must say this review is about Supreme Champion Bicycle at 777 Orchard Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60603. Be extra careful when purchasing . Don't repeat our mistake. I went down to this bicycle shop's Orchard Avenue branch in November 22 2020. I already booked a viewing slot with a customer representative at 2PM in the afternoon. I don't know why but I was put in the waiting list for over 1 hour without any explanation. I was so frustrated after waiting for 45 minutes. I approached the customer service and asked whether I would be able to view the bicycles I had already indicated in my appointment form. The customer service lady said "just wait" with a black face. Finally a little after 3PM, I was taken to the warehouse. But then, the customer representative guy told me I only had 15 minutes for viewing. Ridiculous! I asked for 30 minutes at least and finally they gave in. I had this one bicycle in mind so I decided to just buy it, a black color one. After I indicated my color preference, I had to wait for another (believe it or not) 1 hour 15 minutes. When the bicycle arrived, I found out it was a navy blue color. I told the salesperson I wanted a black one. Then, he disappeared for good 30 minutes. There goes my life my time completely wasted. I ended up leaving for good! What a useless shop making customers wait for so long for what!
